                <h2>...Untouchable</h2>
                <p> The Longman Study Editions constitute a new series of the classics with critical apparatus created by Indian academics for the specific needs of their students. Untouchable remains Mulk Raj Anand's one of the best and most unsettling of novels. It situates with poignancy, precision and unhidden rage the emotionally and socially traumatic experiences of Bakha, an 'untouchable', embedded in the Indian society of the 1930s and the Indian national movement. With its vitality and empathetic detailing, Untouchable, remains unparalleled in revealing the reality of untouchability in India. The essays featured in this edition contextualize Mulk Raj Anand's novel within various critical perspectives, equipping the reader with multiple points of view in the study and appreciation of the work.

                <h2>...Train to Pakistan </h2>
                <p>It is a place, Khushwant Singh goes on to tell us at the beginning of this classic novel, where Sikhs and Muslims have lived together in peace for hundreds of years. Then one day, at the end of the summer, the 'ghost train' arrives, a silent, incredible funeral train loaded with the bodies of thousands of refuges, bringing the village its first taste of the horrors of the civil war. Train to Pakistan is the story of this isolated village that is plunged into the abyss of religious hate. It is also the story of a Sikh boy and a Muslim girl whose love endures and transcends the ravages of war.
